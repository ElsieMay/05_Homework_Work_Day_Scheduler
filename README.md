# 05_Homework_Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery.

I learnt about moment.js, Jquery functions and algorithms, CSS, HTML, local storage, and much more.
